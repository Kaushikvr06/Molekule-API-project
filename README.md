# Molekule API project

## Problem Description

This project makes use of the freely available RESTful API provided by http://football-data.org to retrieve data relate to football (soccer) in JSON format. This data is then processed using Python to retrieve the names of the top 5 goalscorers in 3 different competitions/leagues - English Premier League, Spanish League and UEFA Champions League. 


## Authentication

To enable the retrieval of data, a free account needs to be created. Once that is done, the API authentication token is provided over email.
